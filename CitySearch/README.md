# Simple CitySearch App 🚀

A simple CitySearch🔎App by using Html, CSS 🎨🖌 and Javascript 🤖

Tried this project for implementation of javascript methods 🚀
- Fetch a data from a local file 📁
- Filtering data type by the user using regular expressions and filter method ✨
- Adding Highlight feature was an interesting thing 🤩
